# Reddit Clone App
This application clone is part of a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0AhmAVzOo4) where a reddit clone is built. In this repository you can find my version, which contains a few differences, mostly a better refactoring, some optimizations and different design decisions. The deployed version is available [here](https://read-it-platform.vercel.app/).
